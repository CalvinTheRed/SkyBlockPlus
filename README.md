# SkyBlockPlus
Welcome to SkyBlockPlus! This project was inspired by the 1.19 Skyblock YouTube series published by Ilmango, and aims to recreate that experience for Minecraft 1.21 without strictly requiring the use of any mods.

Add this datapack to a new world during world creation, and watch the magic happen. You should be spawned on a starter island featuring a flat grass platform and a single acacia tree in an empty world. Refer to the custom advancement menu(s) for guidance on how to progress through the datapack's custom features.

This datapack does not provide any special method for locating structures or biomes. As such, it is recommended to enable cheats in your world in order to use `/locate` to find structures and biomes, and to play using the MiniHUD mod to be able to visualize those structures and biomes.
